# Metaheuristics Final Project
Exam Questions : 
#### Discrete optimization: 
Solve Two TSP problems One with 38 cities (Djibouti) and the other with 194 cities (Qatar) 

#### Continuous optimization: You will have to optimize the 6 first functions 
You should provide results for both dimension D = 50 and D = 500. 
1. Shifted Sphere Function 
2. Shifted Schwefel’s Problem 
3. Shifted Rosenbrock’s Function
4. Shifted Rastrigin’s Function
5. Shifted Griewank’s Function
6. Shifted Ackley’s Function

### Prerequesties:
1. You should have anaconda installed (if not go here and install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual))
2. After installation of anaconda create your own environment with python version 3.7 and install following libraries.
  LIBRARIES:
  1. conda install -c conda-forge pygmo
  2. pip install pandas
  3. pip install jmetalpy
  4. pip install tsplib95
  5. pip install matplotlib
  6. pip install numpy
  7. pip install jupyter

### Steps to run the code:(jupyter notebook should be running)
1. Fork this github repo
2. cd to whichever function you want to execute
3. open the .ipynb file and run the cells.
